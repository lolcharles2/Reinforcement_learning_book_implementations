The actor-critic learning algorithm accumulates most of the ideas presented in the book into one algorithm, including eligibility traces, bootstrapping, policy gradient, and value function gradient techniques. It is also the most efficient algorithm on the race car task so far, reaching an average step per episode of 17 after only 10000 episodes. Further training reduces this number down to about 12.2, which is the lowest achieved out of any algorithm presented thus far. 
It is also the first algorithm to find an "advanced strategy." The right of the starting line is not an optimal starting position since the car must make a very sharp turn around the corner. The final policy suggests that at the right of the starting line, the optimal action is to crash into the right track boundary. This resets the car's position randomly on the starting line so it may start at a potentially better position.
